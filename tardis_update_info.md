# Tardis Feature - More infos
If you are here, this meens you are looking for more infos on the warning about the tardis feature.

## Why so much effort to warn us ?
We truly want people to understand that
> **First** <br>
We are a team of 4 peoples working on the mod that are working on the mod.
- 9e_Docteur - Founder, main dev
- PandaRebel - Admin, assets (textures)
- Writili (AKA Plurscraft) - Admin, assets (textures & 3D model), build
- Ghost (AKA GooseySir) - Assets (3D Models)
<br>**And there's a single dev**

## Context
A year ago, we were about to release a small update, for Minecraft 1.19, then 1.20, we needed to refactor (change code to make it work for a version of the api we are using (forge)). And we were about to release the mod and then 9e_Docteur (me) came with an idea to another branch of the mod "the experimental branch, the private and confidencial branch for futur big release of the mod". This branch was mainly made for the Tardis feature, and so i came with an idea to fix the first problem we had, the demat/remat base system.

I told about it with @Killarexe, the second dev at the time, made a working demat/remat extremely basic system. It worked. Then me and him worked to implement the system into the mod.

We are in vacations, and i'm coding days after days all of the feature i wanted to

### The problem
I was seeing to big for a first release. This resulted in a poor code writing, much non-sense and buggy code.

> [!WARNING]
> At first, this is not so dramatic want the experimental branch says in its **readme.md**: "The code can be unclear, buggy, poor, and more..."
> <br> **But**, here the code was barely readable, it exceeded simple poor writing.

### The fix
The fix was a plan we made up.
1. Make "Generic" Panel.
   > 1. Panel that are our custom one not like the one you see on the show.
   > 2. Contains all the basic feature, to demat/remat, change coords/dimension, control the tardis
   > 3. Made as placeholder, to be able to play the mod with the basic tardis system
2. Concentrate our efforts into making the basic tardis system
3. Release the rest of the feature in the futur small updates
4. Cleanup the poor written code, even the rest of the mod / think of a rewrite

## Then why be so worried about to make a "more info" ?
1. We want everyone to understand that this is not easy, this is our first time making a huge, hard and time-consuming feature. We learned only in a year to make the tardis working, and we are learning so much to bring you a nice experience

2. Doctor Who has a lot of tardis (interior, exterior), lot of panels, lot of tardis-feature. But remember, in a team of 4 with only 1 dev, this is not easy to add all of thoses in a single update within a year. So we will release each time a update with new big and small features.

# Conclusion
> [!NOTE]
> Now you understand that this is normal if there's not everything about the tardis in the mod. And we will include more panels and features in the time
